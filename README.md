I merely wanted to preserve this astonishing tool, improving it if possible with the help of knowledgeable people in lua language



Some tips:

The allFiles.exe is a binary unlocked version of WoW.exe (12340), named allFiles because it uses all files inside the wow folder. If you wanna add something, custom patch, or anything, you don't have to put them in an MPQ, you can simply name a folder PATCH-V.MPQ create the folder structure you want and the client will read it as if it was an MPQ.
Also it's patched to use up to around 4 GB of VRAM

So to the fun stuff:

I'll post Mordred's original How-to once I figure out how I can do that, GitHub doesn't like it for some reason. Work in progress.

Account passwords can be saved, they will be put into the /wtf/config.wtf file, into the accountName CVAR.
Realmlists saved will also be put there separated by the separators defined in their respective lua files.

Saving realmlists after closing the client doesn't work for some reason, if you can make i work I'd be really grateful!
